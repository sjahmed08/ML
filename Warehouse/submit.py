#  This script allows you to submit your code to the Udacity hosted autograder
#  for automated testing & grading.
#
#  NOTE: You MUST submit your code via the Canvas Assignment before the
#  stated deadline to receive credit.
#
# The Udacity autograder is very similar to the testing_suite_full.py script
# which allows you to test your code, except it may have different test
# cases, and it also makes sure that you have not accidentually imported
# any modules that exist on your local machine but do not exist in the
# "official" testing environment.
#
# We encourage you to use the remote Udacity autorgrader via this submit
# script, in addition to testing your work locally.
#
# How to use the script:
# 1. `pip install nelson`   (See:  https://pypi.org/project/nelson/ )
# 2. If your account is setup with two-factor, follow the instructions here:
#     https://bonnie.udacity.com/auth_tokens/two_factor
#     Note, you must be logged into bonnie before using the above URL or you
#     will receive a 404 error.
# 3. Create the file warehouse.py in the same directory
# 4. Run `python submit.py` from within the same directory
